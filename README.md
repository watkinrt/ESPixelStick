## ***The v3.x code has been moved to the v3.x branch. Unify (v4.x) is now in main. This code is in a Alpha state. All features have been developed and feedback is needed on usability. Automated / untested binaries are available as artifact attachments to the [actions workflows](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick/actions).***

This is the Arduino based ESPixelStick firmware for ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms. The ESPixelStick firmware supports the control of clockless pixels, DMX512 devices and relays based upon your hardware platform. Pixel limitations are mostly based upon your desired refresh rate, around 800 pixels for a 25ms E1.31 source rate utilizing a single port controller like the ESPixelStick V3.  DDP is supported as well along with Alexa and MQTT support for integration into home automation systems.  On platforms with SD cards available, sequences from xLights may be uploaded for playback in either standalone or FPP Remote modes.

## Hardware

Being open source, you are free to use the ESPixelStick firmware on the device of your choice.  The code however is written specifically for the [ESPixelStick](http://forkineye.com/espixelstick). The ESPixelStick V3 utilizes a Wemos D1 Mini module and provides high current connectors, fusing, power filtering, reverse polarity protection, a differential output driver, SD card reader and proper logic level buffering.  The ESPixelStick V3 is available for purchase from [Forkineye](https://forkineye.com/product/espixelstick-v3/) and if you're in the US, it is available via [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2uqBFuX) as well.  The proceeds go towards things like keeping my wife happy so I can work on this project :)  The ESP32 version of the firmware is targeted for the Lolin D32 Pro. At this time, there is not a pre-made ESP32 controller so it is up to the user to roll their own buffer for the WS281x output and add appropiate power connectors. It does however have a SD card reader.

## Build Requirements

The easiest way to get up and going is to download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick/releases/latest) and use ESPSFlashTool within the release archive to flash a pre-compiled binary.  If you're intent on compiling yourself or wish to modify the source code, you'll need the following software to build this project along with the Arduino IDE.

- [Adruino for ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) - Arduino core for ESP8266
- [Arduino ESP8266 Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin/releases/latest) - Arduino plugin for uploading files to ESP8266 platforms
- [Adruino for ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) - Arduino core for ESP32
- [Arduino ESP32 Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases/latest) - Arduino plugin for uploading files to ESP32 platforms
- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Build system required to process web sources.  Refer to the html [README](html/README.md) for more information.

The following libraries are required. Extract the folder in each of these zip files and place it in the "library" folder under your arduino environment.

Required for all platforms:

- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) - Arduino JSON Library
- [ESPAsyncE131](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPAsyncE131) - Asynchronous E1.31 (sACN) library
- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) - Asynchronous Web Server Library
- [async-mqtt-client](https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client) - Asynchronous MQTT Client
- [Int64String](https://github.com/djGrrr/Int64String) - Converts 64 bit integers into a string
- [EspAlexa](https://github.com/MartinMueller2003/Espalexa) - Alexa Direct control Library
- [Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library) - Servo Motor I2C control
- [Artnet](https://github.com/natcl/Artnet) - Artnet access library
- [ArduinoStreamUtils](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoStreamUtils) - Streaming library

Required for ESP8266:

- [ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP) - Asynchronous TCP Library
- [ESPAsyncUDP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncUDP) - Asynchronous UDP Library

Required for ESP32:

- [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP) - Asynchronous TCP Library
- [LittleFS](https://github.com/lorol/LITTLEFS) - LittleFS for ESP32

## Important Notes on Compiling and Flashing

- ESP-01 modules such as those on the ESPixelStick V1 and V2 are no longer supported as there is not enough flash space. If you have one of these controllers, [ESPixelStick v3.2](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick/releases/tag/v3.2) is the latest supported release.  At least 4MB of flash is required for ESP8266 platforms.
- Web pages **must** be processed, placed into ```data/www```, and uploaded with the upload plugin. Gulp will process the pages and put them in ```data/www``` for you. Refer to the html [README](html/README.md) for more information.
- In order to use the upload plugin, the ESP **must** be placed into programming mode and the Arduino serial monitor **must** be closed.
- ESP8266 modules **must** be configured for 4MB flash and 2MB File System within the Arduino IDE for OTA updates to work.
- For best performance on ESP8266 modules, set the CPU frequency to 160MHz (Tools->CPU Frequency).  You may experience lag and other issues if running at 80MHz.
- For best performance on ESP32 modules, set the PSRAM option to ENABLED (Tools->CPU Frequency).  You may experience lag and other issues if running at 80MHz.
- Depending on your setings of ```Tools->Erase Flash```, you may have to re-upload the filesystem after uploading the sketch.
- If not performing a full erase during sketch upload, it is reccomended that you do a factory reset via the browser admin page after performing a new sketch upload.

## Supported Inputs and Outputs

Details on the supported input protocols and outputs can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick/wiki/Supported-Inputs-and-Outputs).

## Configuration Backup / Restore

The current device configuration can be saved to a local drive using the Backup button on the Admin page. Pressing the Backup button will result in a local file save operation to the default download directory. The file will be named using the Device name from the device configuration page PLUS the ESP unique ID found on the admin page.
The current configuration can be over written from a file located on the local drive (in any directory you chose) by pressing the Restore button on the admin page. A popup will help you select the file to upload.
NOTE: A restore is an OVER WRITE, not a merge. Any changes made since the backup file was created will be lost.
