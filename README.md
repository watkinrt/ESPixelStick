## ***Code in this branch is currently being refactored. It is an Alpha state. All features have been developed and feedback is needed on usability***

This is the Arduino firmware for the ESP8266 and ESP32 based ESPixelStick.  The ESPixelStick is a small wireless E1.31 sACN pixel controller designed to control a single strand of pixels.  Pixel limitations are mostly based upon your desired refresh rate, around 680 pixels (4 universes) for a 25ms E1.31 source rate.  MQTT support is provided as well for integration into home automation systems where an E1.31 source may not be present.

Since this project began, the firmware has moved beyond just pixel support for those with other ESP8266 based devices.  The ESPixelStick firmware now supports outputting E1.31 streams to serial links as well.  Note this is not supported on the ESPixelStick hardware, but intended for other ESP8266 devices such as Bill's RenardESP.

## Hardware

Being open source, you are free to use the ESPixelStick firmware on the device of your choice.  The code however is written specifically for the [ESPixelStick](http://forkineye.com/espixelstick). The ESPixelStick V2 utilizes an ESP-01 module and provides high current connectors, fusing, power filtering, a programming interface and proper logic level buffering.  If you're in the US and would like to purchase an ESPixelStick, they are available via [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2uqBFuX).  The proceeds go towards things like keeping my wife happy so I can work on this project :)
This code has been ported to work on an ESP32 based LoLin pro. This requires the user to add their own buffer for the WS281x output, but allows the user to support local fseq files and FPP Remote operation.

## Requirements

Along with the Arduino IDE, you'll need the following software to build this project:

- [Adruino for ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) - Arduino core for ESP8266

## Important Notes on Compiling and Flashing

- In order to upload your code to the ESP you must put it in flash mode and then take it out of flash mode to run the code. To place your ESP8266 in flash mode your GPIO-0 pin must be connected to ground.
- - Web pages **must** be processed, placed into ```data/www```, and uploaded with the upload plugin. Gulp will process the pages and put them in ```data/www``` for you. Refer to the html [README](html/README.md) for more information.
- In order to use the upload plugin, the ESP **must** be placed into programming mode and the Arduino serial monitor **must** be closed.
- ESP-01 modules **must** be configured for 1M flash and 128k File System within the Arduino IDE for OTA updates to work.
- For best performance on ESP8266 modules, set the CPU frequency to 160MHz (Tools->CPU Frequency).  You may experience lag and other issues if running at 80MHz.
- For best performance on ESP32 modules, set the PSRAM option to ENABLED (Tools->CPU Frequency).  You may experience lag and other issues if running at 80MHz.
- The upload must be redone each time after you rebuild and upload the software
- it is reccomended that you do a factory reset via the browser admin page after uploading a new version of the software.

- Next click on Tools->PSRAM->enabled
- Set the port on which the LoLin is connected: Tools->port->YourPortNumberGoesHere
- Click Sketch->Upload - This will build and upload to the LoLin device

## Supported Inputs 

The configuration has been modified to support multiple (two) input types concurrently. For example you can select E1.31 and Effects at the same time. E1.31 will have higher priority than Effects. Valid input types are:
- Alexa
- DDP
- E1.31
- Effect Engine
- FPP Remote / FSEQ file auto Play / Play Lists
- MQTT

### Alexa Support

Alexa is supported in direct mode. No additional hubs or applications are needed. When Alexa is selected as an input mode, the ESP will be discoverable by the Alexa app as a device that supports 24 bit color. The entire output buffer will be treated (from Alexa's point of view) as a single light bulb 

### DDP

No additional configuration is needed for DDP Support. Simply select it as an input mode and it will listen for DDP messages being sent to the ESP

### E1.31

E1.31 requires additional configuration:

- Starting Universe
- Channels / universe
- Offset into the first universe to first channel (Typically zero)

### Effect Engine

Effect engine provides a list of effects and colors for the effects. Effects will repeat until the engine is turned off.

### FPP Remote / Play FSEQ

FPP / FSEQ support allows the ESP to play files stored on a local SD card. The configuration allows the SPI pins used for the SD Card to be set. 
- When the "FSEQ File to Play" configuration parameter is set to "Play Remote Sequence", the ESP will respond to FPP Sync and play commands.
- When the "FSEQ File to Play" configuration parameter is set to one of the files stored on the ESP, the ESP will play that file on an endless loop.
- When the "FSEQ File To Play" configuration parameter is set to a file with a .pl extension, the file will be parsed and used to control a set of actions performed by the FPP Play List Player.

#### Play List
The ESPixelstick can follow a set of instructions found in a play list file. A playlist file can have any name and up to 20 actions to take. Play List actions are one of the following:
- Play a file (must be an fseq file)
	- Requires the Filename and the number of times to play the file (max 255)
- Play an effect (Effect list can be found in the Effect configuration dropdown)
	- Requires an effect configuration that includes how long to play the effect (max 1000 seconds)
- Pause
	- Requires a time value (up to 1000 seconds)
- The play list file is case sensitive. 
- The effect configuration sections must be present for the effects to function properly.

Here is an example of a Play List File:
```
[
	{
		"type": "file",
		"name": "MySequence.fseq",
		"playcount": 2
	},
	{
		"type": "pause",
		"duration": 5
	},
	{
		"type": "effect",
		"duration": 10,
		"config": 
		{
			"currenteffect": "Chase",
			"EffectSpeed": 6,
			"EffectReverse": false,
			"EffectMirror": false,
			"EffectAllLeds": false,
			"EffectBrightness": 1,
			"EffectBlankTime": 0,
			"EffectWhiteChannel": false,
			"EffectColor": "#0000ff"
		}
	},
	{
		"type": "effect",
		"duration": 5,
		"config": 
		{
			"currenteffect": "Rainbow",
			"EffectSpeed": 6,
			"EffectReverse": false,
			"EffectMirror": false,
			"EffectAllLeds": false,
			"EffectBrightness": 1,
			"EffectBlankTime": 0,
			"EffectWhiteChannel": false,
			"EffectColor": "#b700ff"
		}
	},
	{
		"type": "effect",
		"duration": 10,
		"config": 
		{
			"currenteffect": "Blink",
			"EffectSpeed": 6,
			"EffectReverse": false,
			"EffectMirror": false,
			"EffectAllLeds": false,
			"EffectBrightness": 1,
			"EffectBlankTime": 0,
			"EffectWhiteChannel": false,
			"EffectColor": "#FF0055"
		}
	},
	{
		"type": "file",
		"name": "MyOtherSequence.fseq",
		"playcount": 1
	},
	{
		"type": "pause",
		"duration": 5
	}
]
```

### MQTT Support

MQTT can be configured via the web interface.  When enabled, a payload of "ON" will tell the ESPixelStick to override any incoming E1.31 data with MQTT data.  When a payload of "OFF" is received, E1.31 processing will resume.  The configured topic is used for state, and the command topic will be the state topic appended with ```/set```.

For example, if you enter ```porch/esps``` as the topic, the state can be queried from ```porch/esps``` and commands can be sent to ```porch/esps/set```

If using [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/), it is recommended to enable Home Assistant Discovery in the MQTT configuration.  Your ESPixelStick along with all effects will be automatically imported as an entity within Home Assistant utilzing "Device ID" as the friendly name.  For manual configuration, you can use the following as an example.  When disabling Home Assistant Discovery, ESPixelStick will attempt to remove its configuration entry from your MQTTT broker.

```yaml
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: "Front Porch ESPixelStick"
    state_topic: "porch/esps"
    command_topic: "porch/esps/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
    effect: true
    effect_list:
      - Solid
      - Blink
      - Flash
      - Rainbow
      - Chase
      - Fire flicker
      - Lightning
      - Breathe
      - playFseq
```

Here is an example of playing an fseq file via mqtt

```yaml
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: "Porch ESPixelStick"
    state_topic: "porch/esps"
    command_topic: "porch/esps/set"
    effect: playFseq
    filename: NameOfFileToPlay
    count: 5
```

Here's an example using the mosquitto_pub command line tool:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t porch/esps/set -m '{"state":"ON","color":{"r":255,"g":128,"b":64},"brightness":255,"effect":"solid","reverse":false,"mirror":false}'
```
An example of playing a file three times.
```bash
mosquitto_pub -t porch/esps/set -m '{"state":"ON","brightness":255,"effect":"playFseq","filename":"ESPTuneToTest.fseq","count":3}'
```

### Additional Input Features

The input channels will respond to FPP and xLights discovery requests. xLights also has the ability to auto configure the ESP.

## Supported Outputs

The ESPixelStick firmware can generate the following outputs from incoming data streams, however your hardware must support the physical interface. 
ESP8266-12F platforms support:
- a single serial / Pixel output
- 8 Relay Outputs
- 16 PWM Outputs (I2C bus)

ESP32 platforms support
- two serial / pixel outputs
- 8 Relay outputs
- 16 PWM Outputs (I2C bus)

Each Serial / Pixel output can be configured to support any of the output protocols (no pixel vs serial image).

### Pixel Protocols

- WS2811 / WS2812 / WS2812b (WS281x)
- GE Color Effects

### Serial Protocols

- DMX 512
- Renard
- Generic Serial

### Relay Outputs
We support an output configuration that drives up to eight (8) relay outputs. 
- Each relay output can be configured to be active high or active low. 
- The channel intensity trip point (on/off) is configurable per output.
- The GPIO for each output is configurable

### PWM Outputs
We support up to 16 PWM outputs via the I2C bus. Each output can be configured to map the 8 bit channel intensity values to 4096 PWM timings.
PWM is supported via the PCM9685 16 channel PWM output module. 
This CAN be used to drive DC SSRs to support upto 5 dumb RGB light strings.
